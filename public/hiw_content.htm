                        <p class="description">Mr. Sharma is a senior professor at an engineering college. Being in the
                            profession for years, he is very much aware of the amount of time that goes waste
                            because of tedious attendance taking procedure. Mr. Sharma always wished if he
                            could somehow automate this. So,he posted his problem at DoJugaad. The team at
                            DoJugaad analyzed his problem and developed a biometric sensor based portable
                            device that could be easily rotated in the class. This device could be easily
                            connected to any computer to generate excel sheet of the attendance. This sheet
                            would get periodically updated to the college server. This simple yet smart
                            device has helped not just Mr. Sharma but the entire college to take quick and
                            automatic attendance.</p>

                                So, Akshat shared his idea with our team. Our team of talented engineers and
                                experts discussed and helped to improvise his idea. We presented the idea to our
                                partners.They valued the idea and decided to make it real!<br />
                                The world was introduced to a brilliant invention all thanks to Akshat's role in
                                idea contribution. While Akshat enjoyed his part of share, the world enjoyed his

                                During college days, they would earn money by developing academic projects for other
                                colleagues. However, they wanted to invest their talent into market(or however now
                                they wanted to try their luck in real market). They were ready with many sample
                                products and all they needed was a platform to meet interested investors. Raju and
                                his team approached DoJugaad. We carefully analyzed their products and extended them
                                a chance to interact with our interested investors/sellors/buyers.<br/>
                                DoJugaad thus helped Raju and his team to turn their talent into a full time
