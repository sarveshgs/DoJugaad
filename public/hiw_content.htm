                <p class="hiwcontent" style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Sharma is a senior professor at an engineering college. Being in the profession for years, he is very much aware of the amount of time that goes waste because of tedious attendance taking procedure. Mr. Sharma always wished if he could somehow automate this. So,he posted his problem at DoJugaad. The team at DoJugaad analyzed his problem and developed a biometric sensor based portable device that could be easily rotated in the class. This device could be easily connected to any computer to generate excel sheet of the attendance. This sheet would get periodically updated to the college server. This simple yet smart device has helped not just Mr. Sharma but the entire college to take quick and automatic attendance.</p>
