                                            Our team of talented engineers and experts discussed and helped to improvise his idea.
                                            We presented the idea to our partners.They valued the idea and decided to make it real!

                        Young and energetic Akshat is quite observant. Watching around, he often
                        ends up thinking about some simple yet creative ideas that might help the surrounding to be
                        a better place. However, Akshat faced a serious issue, he felt short of resources and
                        expertise to mould his idea into a working model. So, Akshat shared his idea with our team.
                        Our team of talented engineers and experts discussed and helped to improvise his idea.
                        We presented the idea to our partners.They valued the idea and decided to make it real!
                        The world was introduced to a brilliant invention all thanks to Akshat's role in idea
                        contribution.
                        While Akshat enjoyed his part of share, the world enjoyed his idea as a real time product.

                        Raju and his team are always fascinated in building real life model
                        projects. During college days, they would earn money by developing academic projects for
                        other colleagues. However, they wanted to invest their talent into market(or however now
                        they wanted to try their luck in real market). They were ready with many sample products
                        and all they needed was a platform to meet interested investors. Raju and his team approached
                        DoJugaad. We carefully analyzed their products and extended them a chance to interact with
                        our interested investors/sellors/buyers. DoJugaad thus helped Raju and his team to turn their
                        talent into a full time profession.
