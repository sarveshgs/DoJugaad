                <p class="hiwcontent" style="text-align: justify;">Young and energetic Akshat is quite observant. Watching around, he often ends up thinking about some simple yet creative ideas that might help the surrounding to be a better place. However, Akshat faced a serious issue, he felt short of resources and expertise to mould his idea into a working model.<br /><br />
                So, Akshat shared his idea with our team. Our team of talented engineers and experts discussed and helped to improvise his idea. We presented the idea to our partners.They valued the idea and decided to make it real!<br /><br />
                The world was introduced to a brilliant invention all thanks to Akshat's role in idea contribution. While Akshat enjoyed his part of share, the world enjoyed his idea as a real time product.</p>
