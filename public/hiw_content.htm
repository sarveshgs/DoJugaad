                                       <p>Mr. Sharma is a senior professor at an engineering college. Being in the
                                       profession for years, he is very much aware of the amount of time that goes waste
                                       because of tedious attendance taking procedure. Mr. Sharma always wished if he
                                       could somehow automate this. So,he posted his problem at DoJugaad. The team at
                                       DoJugaad analyzed his problem and developed a biometric sensor based portable
                                       device that could be easily rotated in the class. This device could be easily
                                       connected to any computer to generate excel sheet of the attendance. This sheet
                                       would get periodically updated to the college server. This simple yet smart
                                       device has helped not just Mr. Sharma but the entire college to take quick and
                                       automatic attendance.</p>

                                    <p>Young and energetic Akshat is quite observant. Watching around, he often ends up
                                        thinking about some simple yet creative ideas that might help the surrounding to
                                        be a better place. However, Akshat faced a serious issue, he felt short of
                                        resources and expertise to mould his idea into a working model.<br /><br />
                                        So, Akshat shared his idea with our team. Our team of talented engineers and
                                        experts discussed and helped to improvise his idea. We presented the idea to our
                                        partners.They valued the idea and decided to make it real!<br /><br />
                                        The world was introduced to a brilliant invention all thanks to Akshat's role in
                                        idea contribution. While Akshat enjoyed his part of share, the world enjoyed his
                                        idea as a real time product.</p>

                                    <p>Raju and his team are always fascinated in building real life model projects.
                                    During college days, they would earn money by developing academic projects for other
                                    colleagues. However, they wanted to invest their talent into market(or however now
                                    they wanted to try their luck in real market). They were ready with many sample
                                    products and all they needed was a platform to meet interested investors. Raju and
                                    his team approached DoJugaad. We carefully analyzed their products and extended them
                                    a chance to interact with our interested investors/sellors/buyers.<br/><br/>
                                    DoJugaad thus helped Raju and his team to turn their talent into a full time
                                    profession.</p>

                                        interesting idea description. She knew that this idea perfectly aligned with her
                                        expertise in product design. Shruti submitted her product design model. It was
                                        reviewed and accepted by the team experts.<br /><br />

                                        to practise her interest.<br /><br /></p>
